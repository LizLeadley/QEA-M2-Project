someone who is Liz should be about 80% Liz
someone who isn't Liz should be about 20% Liz 

using 21% Liz null hypothesis:
Liz: chi^2 = 134.4, r = 58:    p<.001
Henry: chi^2 = 49.0533, r=46   .2<p<.97

using 100% Liz null hypothesis for Liz, 21% for Henry
Liz:  chi^2 = 12, r = 58:      p>.995
Henry: chi^2 = 49.0533, r=46   .2<p<.97
