Takeaways:
We're actually pretty on track and not overscoped. We should take a lot of data. They were worried about where to put the phone, but we aren't, we just standardized it.

Plan for moving forward:
-just took data
-Fourier Transform data
-rip Eigenfaces code into useable form
-see what comes out of it
-make a website at some point
-move on to Module 3
